# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
The dataset represents direct markting campaign of a bank. Each record represnts a potential target for deposit placement with the bank and recorded results whether effort led to placement of deposit or not. 
Task of machine learning was to train a binary classification model so as to predict whether a potential target of marketing campaign will place deposit or not. 

We used two machine learning pipelines as follws: 
i) Scikit-learn piple line with Logistic Regrsssion Classifier and hyperdrive for hyperparameter tuning.
ii) Microsoft Azure proprietary AutoML pipeline for automated machine learing including selection of classifiers and their hyperparameters.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**

## Proof of cluster clean up
We used AmlCompute command delete() (documented in our python notebook) to clean up cluster as both pipeline runs has finished.
